          About Us</h2>
      </span>
      <h3 class="subtitle">The Mirus Initiative endeavors to enhance the natural ability of individuals to express
        themselves freely.</h3>
      <div class="details">
        <p><strong>Embracing the unique qualities of every person is what drives society. </strong></p>
        <p>For as long as
          humanity
          has graced this planet we call home, there has been individuality and fellowship. We express ourselves
          uniquely
          and find confidence when we are embraced by family, friends, and strangers alike. We live in a world that
          depends on the special qualities that each of us brings on our own in order for society to prosper.</p>
        <p><strong>Unfortunately, diversity and being ourselves isn't always embraced. </strong></p>
        <p>For many, being ourselves has been met with sentiments that don't embrace us as individuals, simply because
          we were different. Discrimination, harrassment, abuse, and neglect were symptoms of a society that rejected
          our personalities, our ambitions, our personal pursuit of happiness. because of this, many feel shamed,
          fearful to express themselves freely and openly, forcing ourselves to mold to the opinions of others.</p>
        <p><strong>Despite years of seeking fair and equal treatment, marginalized communities continue to suffer.
          </strong></p>
        <p>It's often thought as a thing of the past, especially with laws that are in place meant to protect
          personal expression. However, even in modern times, everyday citizens and officials alike step over the
          safeguards that are meant to ensure our right to be ourselves and live freely.</p>
        <p><strong>We stand by each and every person and the communities that support them. </strong></p>
        <p>The Mirus Initiative was born from the observation that, even in light of societies that take away
          personalities of everyday individuals, communities across the globe sprout out in support of individual
          expressions. In spite of the efforts of those unwilling to embrace distinctions, we stand tall amongst those
          who accept us for being genuine to ourselves. It was in witnessing the perseverance of marginalized persons
          and communities that Sam Aster started working on developing tools that enhanced the natural abilities of
          individuals to be themselves. The Mirus Initiative is the collective source for these tools.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Cosmos: A Discord Client Application</h3>
      <p>Currently being built with Discord.js, Cosmos is a client application concept with some key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Server Creation:</strong> Cosmos takes the time-consuming process of structuring a new server by
          building the server for you. Everything from roles, channels and categories, verification and permission
          management, and content filtering can be ready to go in a matter of seconds, rather than minutes or hours.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Raider Deterence:</strong> For communities that find themselves at the mercy of malicious attackers,
          get some peace of mind with tools that deter and minimize the potential impact that raiders can have on your
          servers. Cosmos can build verification servers and dummy channels that keep raiders separated and oblivious to
          your community. In addition, Cosmos can keep servers backed up, so that in the event a server is raided, you
          can wipe the server and relocate your members to safety as quickly as possible without losing crucial content.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Server Management:</strong> Cosmos is not just for getting you started, but keeping you going.
          Designed for promoting interactivity and inclusivity, Cosmos rewards those who actively and positively
          contributes to the conversation, while discouraging users whose actions brew a negative atmosphere. Automated
          announcements, automod, and seamless role management keeps leaders focused on what matters: spending time with
          their members. </li>
        <li><strong>Bot Presence:</strong> Cosmos is more than just management, it's a friend. Through slash commands
          and active listening, Cosmos is being designed to entertain, uplift, and encourage members in every
          interaction, treating every person as not just a user, but an individual Some features in planned development
          include birthday, holiday, and celebratory announcements, as well as private journaling.</li>
