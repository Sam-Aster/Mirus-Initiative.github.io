        <h2>About Us</h2>

      <h3 class="subtitle">We want to enhance the ability to express yourself freely.</h3>
      <div class="details">
        <p><strong>Embracing the unique qualities of every person is what drives society. </strong></p>
        <p>For as long as humanity has graced this planet we call home, there has been individuality and fellowship. We
          express ourselves uniquely and find confidence when we are embraced by family, friends, and strangers alike.
          We live in a world that depends on the special qualities that each of us bring in order for society to
          prosper.</p>
        <p><strong>Unfortunately, diversity and being ourselves isn't always embraced. </strong></p>
        <p>For many, being ourselves has been met with sentiments that don't accept us as individuals, simply because we
          were different. Discrimination, harrassment, abuse, and neglect were symptoms of a society that rejected our
          personalities, our ambitions, our personal pursuit of happiness. because of this, many feel shamed, fearful to
          express themselves freely and openly, forcing themselves to mold to the opinions of others.</p>
        <p><strong>Despite years of seeking fair and equal treatment, marginalized communities continue to suffer.
          </strong></p>
        <p>It's often thought as a thing of the past, especially with laws that are in place meant to protect
          personal expression. However, even in modern times, everyday citizens and officials alike step over the
          safeguards that are meant to ensure our right to be ourselves and live freely.</p>
        <p><strong>We stand by each and every person and the communities that support them. </strong></p>
        <p>The Mirus Initiative was born from the observation that, even in light of societies that take away the
          personalities and rights of everyday individuals, communities across the globe sprout out in support of
          individual expressions. In spite of the efforts of those unwilling to embrace distinctions, we stand tall
          amongst those who accept us for being genuine to ourselves. It was in witnessing the perseverance of
          marginalized persons and communities that Sam Aster started working on developing tools that enhance the
          natural abilities of individuals to be themselves. The Mirus Initiative is the collective source for these
          tools.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Cosmos: A Discord Client Application</h3>
      <p><strong>Cosmos is in early development and thus not currently available to the public. A closed beta program
          will be available soon.</strong></p>
      <div class="details">
        <p>Designed with Discord.js, one of the most popular programming libraries for Discord clients, Cosmos is an
          application concept with some key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Server Creation:</strong> Cosmos takes the time-consuming process of structuring a new server by
            building the server for you. Everything from roles, channels and categories, verification and permission
            management, and content filtering can be ready to go in a matter of seconds, rather than minutes or hours.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Raider Deterence:</strong> For communities that find themselves at the mercy of malicious
            attackers,
            get some peace of mind with tools that deter and minimize the potential impact that raiders can have on your
            servers. Cosmos can build verification servers and dummy channels that keep raiders separated and oblivious
            to
            your community. In addition, Cosmos can keep servers backed up, so that in the event a server is raided, you
            can wipe the server and relocate your members to safety as quickly as possible without losing crucial
            content.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Server Management:</strong> Cosmos is not just for getting you started, but keeping you going.
            Designed for promoting interactivity and inclusivity, Cosmos rewards those who actively and positively
            contributes to the conversation, while discouraging users whose actions brew a negative atmosphere.
            Automated
            announcements, automod, and seamless role management keeps leaders focused on what matters: spending time
            with
            their members. </li>
          <li><strong>Bot Presence:</strong> Cosmos is more than just management, it's a friend. Through slash commands
            and active listening, Cosmos is being designed to entertain, uplift, and encourage members in every
            interaction, treating every person as not just a user, but an individual Some features in planned
            development
            include birthday, holiday, and celebratory announcements, as well as private journaling.</li>
